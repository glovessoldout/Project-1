# Project-1
The Jupyter Notebook is kind of a mess to navigate because I didn't annotate my code much.  Most of the time I ran the same line over again but to call different columns of the dataframe.
There isn't too much of a difference between my writeup and powerpoint, mostly because I worked more on the powerpoint for presentations.
